# 🧠 Machine Trust Protocol (MTP)

**The Trust Layer of the Machine Civilization**  
*A Foundational, Protocol-Agnostic Standard for Verifiable Machine Trust*  

---

### 📘 Overview

**MTP (Machine Trust Protocol)** defines the verifiable trust layer for the emerging machine civilization —  
enabling machines, agents, and AI systems to cryptographically prove **who they are**, **what they did**, and **why settlement is deserved**.

Developed by **NodeX Labs**, MTP unifies machine identity, proof-of-work, and decentralized settlement  
across **Web2, Web3, and AI infrastructures**, forming the foundation of the **Machine Economy**.

### 🔍 Core Modules

| Module | Function |
|---------|-----------|
| **ProofX** | Verifiable machine identity & attestation (DID/VC compatible) |
| **PoRW** | Proof of Real Work — ensures genuine computation by real devices |
| **MTP-Settlement** | Transport-agnostic settlement via x402 / x403 / L2 / MQTT / gRPC |

---

### 🌐 Interoperability

MTP is designed to integrate seamlessly with:
- **x402 / x403** — machine payment and settlement standards  
- **Google AP2** and **Visa TAP** — agent payment proposals (non-endorsement references)  
- **ERC-8004 / W3C DID/VC** — decentralized identity and verifiable credential schemas  
- **TEE / TPM / ZK / MPC** — hardware & cryptographic verification layers  

---

### ⚙️ Governance

- **Verifier Mesh:** decentralized staking, validation, and slashing mechanisms  
- **Reputation System:** quantifies trust as productive collateral  
- **Open Machine Trust Alliance (OMTA):** open governance & IETF/W3C standardization  

---

### 🗺️ Roadmap (2025–2027)

| Year | Milestone |
|------|------------|
| **2025** | Foundation & Verification — MTP v1.0 release, ProofX/PoRW SDKs |
| **2026** | Interoperability & Scale — cross-standard bindings, adaptive reputation |
| **2027** | Global Standardization — OMTA/IETF/W3C alignment, autonomous governance |

About NodeX Labs

NodeX Labs builds the decentralized compute and trust infrastructure for the Machine Civilization — bridging real compute, AI, and blockchain into a unified, verifiable economy.

Powered by the Machine Trust Protocol (MTP), NodeX enables machines to prove who they are (ProofX), what they do (PoRW), and why they deserve rewards (MTP-Settlement).

Through NodeHub and MTP, NodeX makes it possible to bring any device on-chain, turning computation into verifiable trust and transforming hardware into an economic network of truth.

“Make any device on-chain — and make trust the new compute.”
